Objective:

To analyze manufacturing defect data and identify top defect types, cost drivers, and product quality trends for operational improvement.



Tools Used:



Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Slicers, Charts, Conditional Formatting)



Power Query (for cleaning and combining data)



Mock Data Set from Kaggle



Key KPIs:



KPI	Description

Defect %	Overall defect ratio for production lines

Critical Defect %	Percentage of defects classified as critical

Median Repair Cost	Median cost per repair event

Defects/Product	Average defect frequency per product



Dashboard Features:



Interactive slicers for Month, Severity, Defect Type, and Product



Dynamic charts showing Repair Cost vs Defect Count Trend



“Top 10” and “Bottom 10” product analyses by cost and time between defects



Month-on-Month KPI deltas with visual indicators (↑/↓)



Key Insights:



🔹 Functional defects accounted for 58% of total repair cost.



🔹 Critical severity defects had the highest median repair cost (₹60,000+).



🔹 Cost per defect reduced by 32% month-on-month, indicating improved efficiency.



🔹 Top 3 products contributed 45% of total defects — focus area for quality control.



Outcome:

* Management can identify products with chronic defects ( Repetitive defects , Low Mean-Time-Between-Defect).
* Easily identification of critical KPIs \& their Month on Month variation.
* Process Improvement \& cost control can be easily visualized. 
* Best performing products with least defect can be visualized.
* Stratification based on Severity, location \& defect type for Repair Cost \& Defects.
* Average Repair Cost used to identify trends in Costing.
